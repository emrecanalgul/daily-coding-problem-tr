Huffman coding is a method of encoding characters based on their frequency. Each letter is assigned a variable-length binary string, such as `0101` or `111110`, where shorter lengths correspond to more common letters. To accomplish this, a binary tree is built such that the path from the root to any leaf uniquely maps to a character. When traversing the path, descending to a left child corresponds to a `0` in the prefix, while descending right corresponds to `1`.
	
Here is an example tree (note that only the leaf nodes have letters):
	
```
        *
      /   \
    *       *
   / \     / \
  *   a   t   *
 /             \
c               s
```
	
With this encoding, `cats` would be represented as `0000110111`.
	
Given a dictionary of character frequencies, build a Huffman tree, and use it to determine a mapping between characters and their encoded binary strings.
