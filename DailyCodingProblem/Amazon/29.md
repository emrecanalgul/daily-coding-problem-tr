The  is defined as follows:
	
Suppose you have `N` men and `N` women, and each person has ranked their prospective opposite-sex partners in order of preference.
	
For example, if `N = 3`, the input could be something like this:
	
```
guy_preferences = {
    'andrew': ['caroline', 'abigail', 'betty'],
    'bill': ['caroline', 'betty', 'abigail'],
    'chester': ['betty', 'caroline', 'abigail'],
}

gal_preferences = {
    'abigail': ['andrew', 'bill', 'chester'],
    'betty': ['bill', 'andrew', 'chester'],
    'caroline': ['bill', 'chester', 'andrew']
}
```
	
Write an algorithm that pairs the men and women together in such a way that no two people of opposite sex would both rather be with each other than with their current partners.
