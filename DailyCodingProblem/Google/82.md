You are given a series of arithmetic equations as a string, such as:
	
```
y = x + 1
5 = x + 3
10 = z + y + 2
```
	
The equations use addition only and are separated by newlines. Return a mapping of all variables to their values.
If it's not possible, then return null. In this example, you should return:
	
```
{
  x: 2,
  y: 3,
  z: 5
}
```
