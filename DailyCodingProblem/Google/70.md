A regular number in mathematics is defined as one which evenly divides some power of `60`. Equivalently, we can say that a regular number is one whose only prime divisors are `2`, `3`, and `5`.
	
These numbers have had many applications, from helping ancient Babylonians keep time to tuning instruments according to the diatonic scale.
	
Given an integer `N`, write a program that returns, in order, the first `N` regular numbers.
