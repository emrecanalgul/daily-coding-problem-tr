You are given an N by N matrix of random letters and a dictionary of words. Find the maximum number
of words that can be packed on the board from the given dictionary.
	
A word is considered to be able to be packed on the board if:
	





	
Each tile can be visited only once by any word.
	
For example, given the following dictionary:
	
```
{ 'eat', 'rain', 'in', 'rat' }
```
	
and matrix:
	
```
[['e', 'a', 'n'],
 ['t', 't', 'i'],
 ['a', 'r', 'a']]
```
	
Your function should return 3, since we can make the words 'eat', 'in', and 'rat' without them touching each other.
We could have alternatively made 'eat' and 'rain', but that would be incorrect since that's only 2 words.
