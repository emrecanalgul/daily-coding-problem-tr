UTF-8 is a character encoding that maps each symbol to one, two, three, or four bytes.
	
For example, the Euro sign, â‚¬, corresponds to the three bytes `11100010 10000010 10101100`. The rules for mapping characters are as follows:
	




	
Visually, this can be represented as follows.
	
```
 Bytes   |           Byte format
-----------------------------------------------
   1     | 0xxxxxxx
   2     | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   3     | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   4     | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
```
	
Write a program that takes in an array of integers representing byte values, and returns whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding.
