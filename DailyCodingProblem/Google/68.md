A cryptarithmetic puzzle is a mathematical game where the digits of some numbers are represented by letters. Each letter represents a unique digit.
	
For example, a puzzle of the form:
	
```
  SEND
+ MORE
--------
 MONEY
```
	
may have the solution:
	
```
{'S': 9, 'E': 5, 'N': 6, 'D': 7, 'M': 1, 'O', 0, 'R': 8, 'Y': 2}
```
	
Given a three-word puzzle like the one above, create an algorithm that finds a solution.
