Given a string, return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the string.
	
For example, given the following string:
	
```
MAPTPTMTPA
```
	
Return 7, since the longest palindromic subsequence in the string is `APTMTPA`. Recall that a subsequence of a string does not have to be contiguous!
	
Your algorithm should run in O(n^2) time and space.
