Let A be an N by M matrix in which every row and every column is sorted.
	
Given i, j, i, and j,
compute the number of elements of M smaller than M[i, j] and larger than
M[i, j].
	
For example, given the following matrix:
	
```
[[1, 3, 7, 10, 15, 20],
 [2, 6, 9, 14, 22, 25],
 [3, 8, 10, 15, 25, 30],
 [10, 11, 12, 23, 30, 35],
 [20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]]
```
	
And i = 1, j = 1, i = 3, j = 3,
return 15 as there are 15 numbers in the matrix smaller than 6 or greater than 23.
