Given an array of integers and a number k, where 1 &lt;= k &lt;= length of the array, compute the maximum values of each subarray of length k.
	
For example, given array = [10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7] and k = 3, we should get: [10, 7, 8, 8], since:
	






	
Do this in O(n) time and O(k) space. You can modify the input array in-place and you do not need to store the results. You can simply print them out as you compute them.
