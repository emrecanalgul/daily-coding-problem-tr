Implement locking in a binary tree. A binary tree node can be locked or unlocked
only if all of its descendants or ancestors are not locked.
	
Design a binary tree node class with the following methods:
	





	
You may augment the node to add parent pointers or any other property you would like.
You may assume the class is used in a single-threaded program, so there is no need for actual locks or mutexes.
Each method should run in O(h), where h is the height of the tree.
