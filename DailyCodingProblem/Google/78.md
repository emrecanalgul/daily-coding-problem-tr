You are given a set of synonyms, such as `(big, large)` and `(eat, consume)`. Using this set, determine if two sentences with the same number of words are equivalent.
	
For example, the following two sentences are equivalent:
	




	
Note that the synonyms `(a, b)` and `(a, c)` do not necessarily imply `(b, c)`: consider the case of `(coach, bus)` and `(coach, teacher)`.
	
Follow-up: what if we can assume that `(a, b)` and `(a, c)` do in fact imply `(b, c)`?
