You are given an array `X` of floating-point numbers `x`, `x`, ... `x`. These can be rounded up or down to create a corresponding array `Y` of integers `y`, `y`, ... `y`.
	
Write an algorithm that finds an appropriate `Y` array with the following properties:
	




	
For example, suppose your input is `[1.3, 2.3, 4.4]`. In this case you cannot do better than `[1, 2, 5]`, which has an absolute difference of `|1.3 - 1| + |2.3 - 2| + |4.4 - 5| = 1`.
