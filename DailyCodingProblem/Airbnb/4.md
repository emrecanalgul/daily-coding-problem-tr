Given a linked list and a positive integer `k`, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.
	
For example, given the linked list `7 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 5` and `k = 2`, it should become `3 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 7`.
	
Given the linked list `1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 5` and `k = 3`, it should become `3 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2`.
