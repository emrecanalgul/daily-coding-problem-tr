The “active time” of a courier is the time between the pickup and dropoff of a
delivery. Given a set of data formatted like the following:
	
```
(delivery id, timestamp, pickup/dropoff)
```
	
Calculate the total active time in seconds. A courier can pick up multiple
orders before dropping them off. The timestamp is in unix epoch seconds.
	
For example, if the input is the following:
	
```
(1, 1573280047, 'pickup')
(1, 1570320725, 'dropoff')
(2, 1570321092, 'pickup')
(3, 1570321212, 'pickup')
(3, 1570322352, 'dropoff')
(2, 1570323012, 'dropoff')
```
	
The total active time would be 1260 seconds.
