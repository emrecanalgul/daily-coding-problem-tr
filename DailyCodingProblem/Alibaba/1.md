Given an even number (greater than 2), return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to the given number.
	
A solution will always exist. See .
	
Example:
	
```
Input: 4
Output: 2 + 2 = 4
```
	
If there are more than one solution possible, return the lexicographically smaller solution.
	
If [a, b] is one solution with a &lt;= b, and [c, d] is another solution with c &lt;= d, then
	
```
[a, b] &lt; [c, d]
```
	
If a &lt; c OR a==c AND b &lt; d.
