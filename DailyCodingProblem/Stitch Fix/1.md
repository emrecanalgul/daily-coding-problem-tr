Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of integers constructed with the following formula:
	




	
For example, here are the first few rows:
	
```
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
```
	
Given an input `k`, return the `k` row of Pascal's triangle.
	
Bonus: Can you do this using only `O(k)` space?
