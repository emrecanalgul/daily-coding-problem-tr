Implement integer division without using the division operator. Your function should return
a tuple of (dividend, remainder) and it should take two numbers, the product and divisor.
	
For example, calling `divide(10, 3)` should return `(3, 1)` since the divisor is 3 and the remainder is 1.
	
Bonus: Can you do it in O(log n) time?
