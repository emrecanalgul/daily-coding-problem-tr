Write a function that takes in a number, string, list, or dictionary and returns its JSON encoding. It should also handle nulls.
	
For example, given the following input:
	
```
[None, 123, ["a", "b"], {"c":"d"}]
```
	
You should return the following, as a string:
	
```
'[null, 123, ["a", "b"], {"c": "d"}]'
```
