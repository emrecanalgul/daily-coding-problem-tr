You are going on a road trip, and would like to create a suitable music playlist. The trip will require `N` songs, though you only have `M` songs downloaded, where `M &lt; N`. A valid playlist should select each song at least once, and guarantee a buffer of `B` songs between repeats.
	
Given `N`, `M`, and `B`, determine the number of valid playlists.
