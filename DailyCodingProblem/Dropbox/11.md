A Boolean formula can be said to be satisfiable if there is a way to assign truth values to each variable such that the entire formula evaluates to true.
	
For example, suppose we have the following formula, where the symbol `¬` is used to denote negation:
	
`(¬c OR b) AND (b OR c) AND (¬b OR c) AND (¬c OR ¬a)`
	
One way to satisfy this formula would be to let `a = False`, `b = True`, and `c = True`.
	
This type of formula, with `AND` statements joining tuples containing exactly one `OR`, is known as `2-CNF`.
	
Given a `2-CNF` formula, find a way to assign truth values to satisfy it, or return `False` if this is impossible.
