Implement an efficient string matching algorithm.
	
That is, given a string of length `N` and a pattern of length `k`, write a program that searches for the pattern in the string with less than `O(N * k)` worst-case time complexity.
	
If the pattern is found, return the start index of its location. If not, return `False`.
