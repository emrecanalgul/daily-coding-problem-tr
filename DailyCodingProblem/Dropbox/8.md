Given a list of words, determine whether the words can be chained to form a circle. A word `X` can be placed in front of another word `Y` in a circle if the last character of `X` is same as the first character of `Y`.
	
For example, the words `['chair', 'height', 'racket', touch', 'tunic']` can form the following circle: `chair --&gt; racket --&gt; touch --&gt; height --&gt; tunic --&gt; chair`.
