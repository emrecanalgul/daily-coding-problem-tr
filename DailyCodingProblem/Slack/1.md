You are given an N by M matrix of `0`s and `1`s. Starting from the top left corner, how many ways are there to reach the bottom right corner?
	
You can only move right and down. `0` represents an empty space while `1` represents a wall you cannot walk through.
	
For example, given the following matrix:
	
```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 0]]
```
	
Return two, as there are only two ways to get to the bottom right:
	




	
The top left corner and bottom right corner will always be `0`.
