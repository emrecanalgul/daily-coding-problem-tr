The horizontal distance of a binary tree node describes how far left or right the node will be when the tree is printed out.
	
More rigorously, we can define it as follows:
	





	
For example, for the following tree, `hd(1) = -2`, and `hd(6) = 0`.
	
```
             5
          /     \
        3         7
      /  \      /   \
    1     4    6     9
   /                /
  0                8
```
	
The bottom view of a tree, then, consists of the lowest node at each horizontal distance. If there are two nodes at the same depth and horizontal distance, either is acceptable.
	
For this tree, for example, the bottom view could be `[0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9]`.
	
Given the root to a binary tree, return its bottom view.
