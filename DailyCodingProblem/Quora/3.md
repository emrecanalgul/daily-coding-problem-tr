You are given a list of `(website, user)` pairs that represent users visiting websites. Come up with a program that identifies the top `k` pairs of websites with the greatest similarity.
	
For example, suppose `k = 1`, and the list of tuples is:
	
```
[('a', 1), ('a', 3), ('a', 5),
 ('b', 2), ('b', 6),
 ('c', 1), ('c', 2), ('c', 3), ('c', 4), ('c', 5)
 ('d', 4), ('d', 5), ('d', 6), ('d', 7),
 ('e', 1), ('e', 3), ('e': 5), ('e', 6)]
```
	
Then a reasonable similarity metric would most likely conclude that `a` and `e` are the most similar, so your program should return `[('a', 'e')]`.
