Given an arithmetic expression in , write a program
to evaluate it.
	
The expression is given as a list of numbers and operands. For example: `[5, 3, '+']` should return `5 + 3 = 8`.
	
For example, `[15, 7, 1, 1, '+', '-', '/', 3, '*', 2, 1, 1, '+', '+', '-']` should return `5`, since it is equivalent to ((15 / (7 - (1 + 1))) * 3) - (2 + (1 + 1)) = 5.
	
You can assume the given expression is always valid.
