On a mysterious island there are creatures known as Quxes which come in three colors: red, green, and blue. One power of the Qux is that if two of them are standing next to each other, they can transform into a single creature of the third color.
	
Given `N` Quxes standing in a line, determine the smallest number of them remaining after any possible sequence of such transformations.
	
For example, given the input `['R', 'G', 'B', 'G', 'B']`, it is possible to end up with a single Qux through the following steps:
	
```
        Arrangement       |   Change
----------------------------------------
['R', 'G', 'B', 'G', 'B'] | (R, G) -&gt; B
['B', 'B', 'G', 'B']      | (B, G) -&gt; R
['B', 'R', 'B']           | (R, B) -&gt; G
['B', 'G']                | (B, G) -&gt; R
['R']                     |
```
