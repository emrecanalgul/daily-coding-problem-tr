Mastermind is a two-player game in which the first player attempts to guess the secret code of the second. In this version, the code may be any six-digit number with all distinct digits.
	
Each turn the first player guesses some number, and the second player responds by saying how many digits in this number correctly matched their location in the secret code. For example, if the secret code were `123456`, then a guess of `175286` would score two, since `1` and `6` were correctly placed.
	
Write an algorithm which, given a sequence of guesses and their scores,
determines whether there exists some secret code that could have produced them.
	
For example, for the following scores you should return `True`, since they correspond to the secret code `123456`:
	
```
{175286: 2, 293416: 3, 654321: 0}
```
	
However, it is impossible for any key to result in the following scores, so in this case you should return `False`:
	
```
{123456: 4, 345678: 4, 567890: 4}
```
