A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different colors. He has
a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.
	
Given an N by K matrix where the n row and k column represents the cost to build the n
house with k color, return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.
