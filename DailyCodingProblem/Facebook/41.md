We have some historical clickstream data gathered from our site anonymously
using cookies. The histories contain URLs that users have visited in chronological order.
	
Write a function that takes two users' browsing histories as input and returns the
longest contiguous sequence of URLs that appear in both.
	
For example, given the following two users' histories:
	
```
user1 = ['/home', '/register', '/login', '/user', '/one', '/two']
user2 = ['/home', '/red', '/login', '/user', '/one', '/pink']
```
	
You should return the following:
	
```
['/login', '/user', '/one']
```
