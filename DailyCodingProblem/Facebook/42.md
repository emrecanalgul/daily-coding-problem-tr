Given a list of strictly positive integers, partition the list into 3 contiguous partitions which each sum up to the same value. If not possible, return null.
	
For example, given the following list:
	
```
[3, 5, 8, 0, 8]
```
	
Return the following 3 partitions:
	
```
[[3, 5],
 [8, 0],
 [8]]
```
	
Which each add up to 8.
