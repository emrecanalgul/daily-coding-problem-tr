Given a linked list of numbers and a pivot `k`, partition the linked list so that all nodes less than `k` come before nodes greater than or equal to `k`. 
	
For example, given the linked list `5 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 3` and `k = 3`, the solution could be `1 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 3`.
