You are given a binary tree in a peculiar string representation. Each node is written in the form `(lr)`, where `l` corresponds to the left child and `r` corresponds to the right child.
	
If either `l` or `r` is null, it will be represented as a zero. Otherwise, it will be represented by a new `(lr)` pair.
	
Here are a few examples:
	





	
Given this representation, determine the depth of the tree.
