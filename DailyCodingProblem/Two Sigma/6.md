# Two Sigma ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MEDIUM-yellow)
	
Given two sorted iterators, merge it into one iterator.
	
For example, given these two iterators:
	
```
foo = iter([5, 10, 15])
bar = iter([3, 8, 9])
```
	
You should be able to do:
	
```
for num in merge_iterators(foo, bar):
    print(num)

# 3
# 5
# 8
# 9
# 10
# 15
```
	
Bonus: Make it work without pulling in the contents of the iterators in memory.
