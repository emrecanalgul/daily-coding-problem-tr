You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell consists of either `/`, `\`, or an empty space. Write an algorithm that determines into how many regions the slashes divide the space.
	
For example, suppose the input for a three-by-six grid is the following:
	
```
\    /
 \  /
  \/
```
	
Considering the edges of the matrix as boundaries, this divides the grid into three triangles, so you should return `3`.
