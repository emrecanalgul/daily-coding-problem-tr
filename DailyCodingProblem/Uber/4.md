Implement a 2D iterator class. It will be initialized with an array of arrays, and should implement the following methods:
	




	
For example, given the input [[1, 2], [3], [], [4, 5, 6]], calling `next()` repeatedly should output `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.
	
Do not use `flatten` or otherwise clone the arrays. Some of the arrays can be empty.
