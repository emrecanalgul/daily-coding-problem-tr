Implement the function `embolden(s, lst)` which takes in a string `s` and list of substrings `lst`,
and wraps all substrings in `s` with an HTML bold tag `&lt;b&gt;` and `&lt;/b&gt;`.
	
If two bold tags overlap or are contiguous, they should be merged.
	
For example, given `s = abcdefg` and `lst = ["bc", "ef"]`, return the string `a&lt;b&gt;bc&lt;/b&gt;d&lt;b&gt;ef&lt;/b&gt;g`.
	
Given `s = abcdefg` and `lst = ["bcd", "def"]`, return the string `a&lt;b&gt;bcdef&lt;/b&gt;g`, since they overlap.
