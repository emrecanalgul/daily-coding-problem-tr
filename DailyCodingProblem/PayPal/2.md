Given a string and a number of lines `k`, print the string in zigzag form. In zigzag, characters are printed out diagonally from top left to bottom right until reaching the `k` line, then back up to top right, and so on. 
	
For example, given the sentence `"thisisazigzag"` and `k = 4`, you should print:
	
```
t     a     g
 h   s z   a
  i i   i z
   s     g
```
