A Cartesian tree with sequence `S` is a binary tree defined by the following two properties:
	




	
For example, given the sequence `[3, 2, 6, 1, 9]`, the resulting Cartesian tree would be:
	
```
      1
    /   \   
  2       9
 / \
3   6
```
	
Given a sequence `S`, construct the corresponding Cartesian tree.
