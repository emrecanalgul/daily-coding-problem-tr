A network consists of nodes labeled `0` to `N`. You are given a list of edges `(a, b, t)`, describing the time `t` it takes for a message to be sent from node `a` to node `b`. Whenever a node receives a message, it immediately passes the message on to a neighboring node, if possible.
	
Assuming all nodes are connected, determine how long it will take for every node to receive a message that begins at node `0`. 
	
For example, given `N = 5`, and the following edges:
	
```
edges = [
    (0, 1, 5),
    (0, 2, 3),
    (0, 5, 4),
    (1, 3, 8),
    (2, 3, 1),
    (3, 5, 10),
    (3, 4, 5)
]
```
	
You should return `9`, because propagating the message from `0 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4` will take that much time.
