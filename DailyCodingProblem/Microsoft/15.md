Let's represent an integer in a linked list format by having each node represent a digit in the number.
The nodes make up the number in reversed order.
	
For example, the following linked list:
	
```
1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 5
```
	
is the number 54321.
	
Given two linked lists in this format, return their sum in the same linked list format.
	
For example, given
	
```
9 -&gt; 9
```
	
```
5 -&gt; 2
```
	
return 124 (99 + 25) as:
	
```
4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1
```
