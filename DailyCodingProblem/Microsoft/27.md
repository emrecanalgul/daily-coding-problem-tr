Given an array of numbers `arr` and a window of size `k`, print out
the median of each window of size `k` starting from the left and moving
right by one position each time.
	
For example, given the following array and `k = 3`:
	
```
[-1, 5, 13, 8, 2, 3, 3, 1]
```
	
Your function should print out the following:
	
```
5 &lt;- median of [-1, 5, 13]
8 &lt;- median of [5, 13, 8]
8 &lt;- median of [13, 8, 2]
3 &lt;- median of [8, 2, 3]
3 &lt;- median of [2, 3, 3]
3 &lt;- median of [3, 3, 1]
```
	
Recall that the median of an even-sized list is the average of the two middle numbers.
